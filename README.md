## 🧠 Learning Philosophy

Each DSA problem is paired with:

1. 📜 A clear problem statement  
2. ⚙️ Input/output format and constraints  
3. 🔍 Detailed step-by-step explanation  
4. ⌨️ Live code editor for instant attempts  

This mirrors real-world tech interviews, preparing users through **active learning** and **repetition**.
